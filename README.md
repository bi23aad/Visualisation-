# Visualisation-
Applying three different types of visualization methods, to extract meaningful information. 
Produce a line plot showing multiple lines with proper labels and legend. Describe
what conclusions you can draw from this plot.
2. Produce graphs using two other visualisation methods. Explain why you picked this
type of graph and describe what conclusions you can draw. Marks will be awarded
for plausible choices of graphs. The choice does not need to be the perfect one, but
at least one type will not be a good choice if you visualise exactly the same data
three times. Note, that we consider it not exactly the same, if you do a line plot of
a time series and then use a pie chart to visualise relative sizes for a selected time.
Use spyder or a similar programming environment, not notebook.
• Use pyplot. No marks will be awarded for graphs produced using other packages.
• Follow the instructions in the good coding style guide. Use autopep8 to make your
code PEP-8 conform.
• Check the rubrics and the mark spreadsheet. Are you ticking all the boxes?
• Avoid academic misconduct. See the instructions in the Academic misconduct and
how to avoid it unit.
